How did this go, overall?
  Is it okay to cry? This lab was really rough for me. From the get go I didn't really know how to start. Then once I had a firm start I really struggled with the objective.
What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
  I'm really noticing that I struggle to understand how to start projects. This stuffs hard, it's rewarding once we get going but getting going can be really touch and go. 
How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? I knew going in that I wasn't really sure what I was doing. So I had a feeling it would take me all night, and it did take me all night! about 7 hours.
