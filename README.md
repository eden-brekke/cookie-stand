Reflections and Comments <br>
How did this go, overall?
  Is it okay to cry? This lab was really rough for me. From the get go I didn't really know how to start. Then once I had a firm start I really struggled with the objective.
What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
  I'm really noticing that I struggle to understand how to start projects. This stuffs hard, it's rewarding once we get going but getting going can be really touch and go. 
How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? I knew going in that I wasn't really sure what I was doing. So I had a feeling it would take me all night, and it did take me all night! about 7 hours. 

## LAB 7
Continuing the Cookie Stand <br>
Replace all of your object literals for the salmon cookie stand with a single constructor function that, when called with the ‘new’ keyword, it creates a new instance <br>
Replace the lists of your data for each store and build a single table of data instead. <br>
Display each stores data in a table format similar to what is below. Break each column by the hour and complete each row with a “Daily Location Total”. <br>

Friends again, from the previous lab, since this lab was just a lot of converting what I already had into a constructor and taking the data I was putting in lists before into a table <br>
I mostly used Audrey's examples to build out my DOM manipulation <nr>
Also used MDN web docs [Document Object Model (DOM) page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) <br>


Reflection and Comments: <br>
How did this go, overall?<br>
This lab was a lot easier for me. Since it was a lot of just taking information from the last name and converting it to a constructor. I completely discarded what I did with DOM manipulation in the previous lab and just rewrote the DOM manipulation to make a table. I started by trying to rewrite that but it was too confusing for me. <br>

it was a bit confusing because tr and td are so similar, my head was kind of spinning. <br>

What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?<br>
After I was finished I did notice that I did not use the prototype functions so I'm not sure I completely understand that concept and how I should be using it. 
I think I should challenge myself to go back and try to figure that out. <br>

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?<br>
this assignment only took me about an hour and a half, and I was pretty confident going in that I would be able to get this done quickly, since I already had the tough stuff figured out from the previous lab. <br>
